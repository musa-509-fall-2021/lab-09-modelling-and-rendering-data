# Lab: Modeling and Rendering Data

In this lab we will implement the following dashboard by modeling data in BigQuery and rendering Jinja templates.

![Dashboard screenshot](dashboard-screenshot.png)

We will be using data from the US Census to implement the dashboard. Specifically, the following public BigQuery datasets:
* `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.blockgroup_2010_5yr` through `..._2018_5yr`
  * Specific useful fields:
    * `geo_id`
    * `total_pop`
    * `male_pop`
    * `female_pop`
    * `white_pop`
    * `black_pop`
    * `asian_pop`
    * `hispanic_pop`
    * `amerindian_pop`
    * `other_race_pop`
    * `two_or_more_races_pop`
* `bigquery-public-data.geo_census_blockgroups.blockgroups_42` (`42` is the FIPS code for Pennsylvania)
  * Specific useful fields:
    * `geo_id`
    * `blockgroup_geom`
    * `county_fips_code` (Philadelphia is county `101`)

## Process

0.  _(optional)_ Fork this repository to your account, if you want to keep your work.

1.  Clone this repository (or your forked version) to your computer.

1.  Create a virtual environment with the following packages installed: `pandas`, `geopandas`, `pandas-gbq`, `google-cloud-bigquery-storage`, `google-cloud-storage`, `jinja2`.

1.  Modify the code at the beginning of _src/transform_data.py_ and _src/render_report.py_ to point to the location of your GCP service account credentials (create a new [service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) or download new keys if you don't have any around).

1.  Run the render report script, just to make sure that everything is installed and configured correctly:

    ```bash
    python src/render_report.py
    ```

    After running, you should have a file called _output/index.html_. You should be able to open that in a browser (it won't be very exciting ... yet).

### Create and run data model(s)

5.  In the Google Cloud Platform console, create a BigQuery dataset named `lab09`.

1.  Implement the query needed in the _src/sql/lab09/model_blockgroups.sql_ model file. Use the [BigQuery console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) as necessary to explore data. Alternatively, if it is more comfortable, you can use a Jupyter notebook to explore the data.

1.  Run the data transformations module to create the blockgroups model and its downstream tables.

    ```bash
    python src/transform_data.py
    ```

    Ensure that the tables that you expect were created in your BigQuery account. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below if you get an error while running the script.

### Add map data into the report

8.  Read and understand the following code. What it does is:
    1.  Uses a `SELECT` query to read the `blockgroups_mapdata` table into a Pandas `DataFrame`. This will include geographic data formatted as WKT strings.
    2.  Converts the geospatial column (`blockgroup_geom`) into geometry objects in memory.
    3.  Creates a GeoPandas `GeoDataFrame`, which knows how to output the data as GeoJSON, which is something we can't get from a normal Pandas `DataFrame`.

    ```py
    mapdata_df = pd.read_gbq('SELECT * FROM lab09.blockgroups_mapdata')
    mapdata_df.blockgroup_geom = gpd.GeoSeries.from_wkt(mapdata_df.blockgroup_geom)
    mapdata_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(mapdata_df, geometry='blockgroup_geom')
    ```

    In the _render_report.py_ module, paste the above code in place of the ellipses (`...`) under the `# Download the map data.` comment. Then, under the line that says `# TEMPLATE DATA GOES HERE`, add the following:

    ```py
    mapdata=mapdata_gdf.to_json(),
    ```

    That will make a GeoJSON representation of the map data available in the template in a variable named `mapdata`.

1.  In your _index.html_ template, find the line that says `var densitymapdata = null;`. Replace this line with the following:

    ```js
    var densitymapdata = {{ mapdata }};
    ```

1.  Run the _render_report.py_ script again (in the same way as in step #4) and ensure that you have map data on your map.

### Add chart data into the report

11. Read and understand the following code:

    ```py
    chartdata_df = pd.read_gbq('SELECT * from lab09.blockgroups_chartdata')
    ```

    Since we're not concerned about any geospatial fields in this data, we don't need to convert it to a `GeoDataFrame`. Add the above line to _render_report.py_ module, replacing the elipses (`...`) below `# Download the chart data.`. Then, add the following to the template data:

    ```py
    chartdata=chartdata_df.to_dict('list'),
    ```

    That line should make a dictionary of data available in the template under the name `chartdata`. The dictionary will be formatted with a **list** of values corresponding to each field. For example:

    ```py
    {
        'year': [ ... ],
        'total_male_pop': [ ... ],
        'total_female_pop': [ ... ],
        'total_white_pop': [ ... ],
        'total_black_pop': [ ... ],
        ...
    }
    ```

    Each of the lists will have values in the same order, going from the top to the bottom of the query results.

1.  In your _index.html_ template, find the following lines:
    ```js
    var sexchartdata = [
        [ 'Year', ...[] ],
        [ 'Male', ...[] ],
        [ 'Female', ...[] ],
    ];
    ```

    Replace those lines with the following:
    ```js
    var sexchartdata = [
        ['Year', ...{{ chartdata['year'] }}],
        ['Male', ...{{ chartdata['total_male_pop'] }}],
        ['Female', ...{{ chartdata['total_female_pop'] }}]
    ];
    ```

1.  In your _index.html_ template, find the following lines:
    ```js
    var racechartdata = [
        [ 'Year', ...[] ],
        [ 'White', ...[] ],
        [ 'Black', ...[] ],
        [ 'Asian', ...[] ],
        [ 'Hispanic', ...[] ],
        [ 'Amerindian', ...[] ],
        [ 'Other Race', ...[] ],
        [ 'Two or More Races', ...[] ],
    ];
    ```

    Replace those lines with the following:
    ```js
    var racechartdata = [
        ['Year', ...{{ chartdata['year'] }}],
        ['White', ...{{ chartdata['total_white_pop'] }}],
        ['Black', ...{{ chartdata['total_black_pop'] }}],
        ['Asian', ...{{ chartdata['total_asian_pop'] }}],
        ['Hispanic', ...{{ chartdata['total_hispanic_pop'] }}],
        ['Amerindian', ...{{ chartdata['total_amerindian_pop'] }}],
        ['Other Race', ...{{ chartdata['total_other_race_pop'] }}],
        ['Two or More Races', ...{{ chartdata['total_two_or_more_races_pop'] }}],
    ];
    ```

1.  Run the _render_report.py_ script again (in the same way as in step #4) and ensure that you have data in your charts.

### Add textual data into the report

15. Read and understand the following code:

    ```py
    listdata_df = pd.read_gbq('SELECT * from lab09.blockgroups_listdata')
    ```

    Add the above line to _render_report.py_ module, replacing the elipses (`...`) below `# Download the population density list data.`. Then, add the following to the template data:

    ```py
    listdata=listdata_df.to_dict('records'),
    ```

    That line should make a list of dictionaries, one for each **record** in the `blockgroups_listdata` table, and make it available in the template under the name `listdata`. The list will be formatted similar to:

    ```py
    [
        {'year': 2018, 'geo_id': '421010183001', pop_density: ...},
        {'year': 2018, 'geo_id': '421010359002', pop_density: ...},
        {'year': 2018, 'geo_id': '421010168006', pop_density: ...},
        ...
    ]
    ```

1.  In your _index.html_ template, find the following lines:
    ```html
    <div id="densitylist">
    </div>
    ```

    Add the following code _inside_ of that `div` element:
    ```html+jinja
    <p>The 5 most densely populated block groups during {{ listdata[0].year }} are:</p>
    <ul>
      {% for record in listdata %}
        <li>{{ record.geo_id }} with a density of {{ record.pop_density | round(4) }} people per sq. meter</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    ```

1.  Run the _render_report.py_ script again (in the same way as in step #4) and ensure that you have data in your list.

## Definitions

* **Data Model**: Data modeling is a process used to define data requirements needed to support a business processes. A data model is a design that dictates how pieces of data relate to one another to support those processes.

  Often in a data model you will have a table for each significant noun within your domain. It is increasingly common for each one of these tables themselves to be called a **model** (I think largely due to the influence of [DBT](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models)).

* **Upstream/Downstream**: If one model (_B_) depends on another model (_A_) having been created, then we say that _B_ is downstream of _A_, or _A_ is upstream of _B_.

## Troubleshooting
* If you see an error like:
  ```
  Forbidden: 403 POST https://bigquery.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2/projects/.../ jobs?prettyPrint=false: Access Denied: Project ...: User does not have  bigquery.jobs.create permission in project ...
  ```
  Then you need to set your `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` value.

* If you see an error like:
  ```
  404 Not found: Dataset ...:lab09 was not found in location ...
  ```
  Then you probably didn't create the `lab09` dataset in BigQuery.
